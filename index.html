<h1>Hello Cyr,</h1>
<p>This is hosted for free with GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>You could have your site here and it wouldn't need to go through Netlify.</p>
<p>The code has to be public unless you pay for GitHub pro, but your current code is already public so I don't think that matters too much.</p>
<p>There's a small delay after a commit before changes show up, but it's not nearly as long this way.</p>
<p>Your existing domain could be made to point here instead, so people would still visit your normal site. It would just be going through GitHub directly instead of Netlify. Visitors wouldn't notice any change.</p>
